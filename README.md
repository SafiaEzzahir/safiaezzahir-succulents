# safiaezzahir-succulents
this is my really simple portfolio of my favourite little plants!!

it is still in progress, so that's why some of the pages say "coming soon".

i basically just used CSS and HTML to make it, but all of the code is mine (zero AI or tutorials!!) as i mostly tried to work from memory. the photos and "art" is also all mine :)

thanks for visiting! don't hesitate to check out my code
