this is my really simple portfolio of my favourite little plants!! hover over the images to find out more about what plant it is, when the photo was taken, and my favourite facts about that plant. my wishlist also contains some cool varieties that i really want to buy.

i basically just used CSS and HTML to make it, but all of the code is mine (zero AI or tutorials!!) as i mostly tried to work from memory. the photos and "art" is also all mine :)

it is still in progress, so that's why some of the pages say "coming soon".

thanks for visiting! don't hesitate to check out my code
